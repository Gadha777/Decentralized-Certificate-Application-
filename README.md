# Decentralized Certificate Issuing Application (DApp)

This is a decentralized application (DApp) designed to issue and verify certificates on the Ethereum blockchain. It leverages smart contracts written in Solidity and is built with React.js for the frontend. MetaMask (or any compatible Web3 wallet) is used to interact with the Ethereum blockchain, making certificate issuance and verification secure and transparent.

## Overview

In this system:

- **Smart Contracts** will be used to issue and verify certificates.
- **MetaMask** (or any Web3 wallet) will be used for user interaction with the blockchain.
- **React.js** will serve as the frontend for user interaction.
- **Solidity** will be used to write the smart contract.

## Key Features

- **Issue Certificates**: Admins can issue certificates to users.
- **Verify Certificates**: Users can view and verify their certificates using a unique certificate ID.
- **Blockchain Storage**: All certificates are stored securely on the Ethereum blockchain, ensuring immutability and transparency.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Blockchain**: Ethereum
- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity
- **Web3 Library**: ethers.js
- **Wallet**: MetaMask for connecting to the blockchain

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or later)
- npm or yarn (package manager)
- MetaMask extension or another Ethereum-compatible wallet
- A local Ethereum node or use the Rinkeby testnet for testing

### Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/CertDapp.git
   cd CertDapp
